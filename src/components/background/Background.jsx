            <br />
            <p>
                I am an aspiring final-year software engineering student, a part-time software intern at UTS Rapido, and a coding instructor.
                <p>
                I have a strong passion for coding and am proficient in a variety of programming languages, database frameworks, and other software frameworks. 
                </p>
                I would love to use these skills to contribute to the creation of useful software products. 
                <p>Being a full-stack web developer is my career objective, and now I’m on the journey of achieving my goal. </p>
                </p>
                <p>
                During my time at university, I have gained various skills in software and out of all the other streams in software, web development was the one that caught my interest and that’s when I decided to pursue it as my career. 
                The work experience I have gained so far has taught me the importance of engineering and agile development along with the impact it makes on your career.
                <p>I have built a few projects such as a model restaurant website, and a model banking website during my free time.</p>
                <p>
                I'm still driven and diligent, and I try to take advantage of any chance I have. In the coming years, I hope to learn and grow with every opportunity.
