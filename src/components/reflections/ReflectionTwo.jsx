        Reflection on Professional Practice within an intercultural and global context
        </h1>
    <br />
     <br />
    During my 3rd year in Engineering, I got an internship opportunity at a company in Australia. 
    This company had people from different parts of the country who supported various cultures at 
    the office. It was very new, and I was still getting used to the environment and how things work 
    at my workplace. After a few days, I have been told to do a presentation about the project that 
    I have been working on, in one of the monthly meetings that we have internally. Since it was a 
    monthly meeting and was assuming it to be very casual and hence, I haven’t prepared much. 
    This assumption was based on the previous internship experiences that I had in India. So, on 
    the day of the presentation, I wanted to make gain the attention of the audience and I cracked 
    a joke. None of them laughed and it made me feel weird. I started to fumble a lot during the 
    presentation. I completed the presentation and I just felt none of them understood or felt it 
    was good. Then after the presentation, my manager who was also an Indian had come to me 
    and told me that the presentation was not great and helped me understand the reasons behind 
    that. He explained to me clearly how difficult it was for him when he initially came and how he 
    adapted to the changes accordingly. Soon after my manager left, one of my colleagues who was 
    not an Indian came to me and gave me some feedback and tips to reflect on. She told me that it 
    was fine and to do better next time. 
    <br />
    <br />
     
    I felt so sad during and after the presentation and I felt unaccepted. I was even scared to go to 
    people and ask them for feedback. I felt so stressed and hadn’t been able to concentrate. Once, 
    my manager and other colleague came and tried to talk me through it, and that’s when I felt a 
    bit better.

    The need of building intercultural competency and globalisation adaptation skills and capacities 
    for engineers is underlined. Intercultural and global contexts are considered as the core values 
    to be successful in a future career (Jones, 2013). According to Bennett (2004), adjusting to 
    cultural differences requires people to practise empathy, which is the capacity to comprehend 
    and adopt the viewpoint of someone from a different culture. This is something that happened 
    to me when my colleague and my manager try to understand me and gave me feedback to 
    improve.

    In Future, I will make sure to prepare well and not take anything for granted. I will also make 
    sure to understand people before I make a statement that way I don’t pass any wrong 
    statements. I have also understood the importance of adaptability and the factors that drive 
    one’s performance. I will also make sure to speak slowly and clearly so that people can 
    understand the words that I am speaking. I have also learnt that it is okay to be not accepted by 
    people professionally as everyone has different perspectives.
