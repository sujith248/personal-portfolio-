    During one of the internships, I was working with a group of five people, and we were 
    instructed that we must all adhere to the agile development processes throughout the project.  
    Although agile development is followed in most places, I only had a rough idea about the 
    development process and therefore I was planning on more emphasis on the result than the 
    process and procedure since I was new and wanted to establish myself via the job. We, 
    therefore, received a list of tasks for the sprint on Jira (a project management platform), and 
    we were instructed to update Jira based on the job we were working on. I began working on 
    the tasks but completely neglected to update them on Jira since I was more concerned with 
    doing them swiftly and thoroughly than others. After a week or two, I realised I needed to 
    update my tasks on Jira, which created significant conflicts with the work of the other team 
    members. According to the Jira board, my sprint was about to expire, and I hadn't completed 
    any work. So, I decided to take on a new task since I realised there was nothing, I could do to 
    change the situation, and as a result, I ended up being the team member who completed the 
    fewest tasks overall. So, because of my mindset, the same work has been done twice. This 
    mindset of having to do things on my own has had an impact on me, and as a result, I've come 
    to realise that I need to handle things professionally rather than rapidly. 
    <br />
    <br />
     
    During this time of the incident, I was very angry with myself for not following the workplace 
    procedures and for not being able to adapt to the new workplace procedures. I felt sad about 
    the result as it was not the result, I intended it to be. I also doubted my abilities and started 
    going down the negative lane, which impacted my work for a few days and hence I couldnâ€™t get 
    more tasks done by the end of that sprint. 
    <br />
    <br />
     
    Until this incident happened, I had believed that it is only important to complete tasks 
    efficiently at a workplace and that is the only driving factor to be able to show good results. I 
    also carried this 2nd year's university student mindset to my workplace and treated my work like 
    a university project.  
    <br />
    <br />
     
    The advantages of adhering to workplace regulations and processes assist those who work to 
    maintain consistency and uniformity in decision-making. Additionally, it keeps everyone on the 
    same page, which saves time when an issue develops, prevents disagreements, and prevents 
    having to redo the same job (NSW Government, n.d). Following agile development procedures 
    can lead to increased performance of the individuals and thereby increases the efficiency of the 
    team. To be able to yield better and more sustainable results, efficient use of the resources 
    needs to be done (Kumar & Bhatia Kumar, 2012). 
    <br />
    <br />
     
    I understood using resources correctly is how sustainable engineering is practised. I also have 
    understood the importance of the agile development methodology and made me realize how 
    important it is for everyone on the project of your team to stay on the same page. In the 
    Future, I hope to follow the workplace procedures and adapt to the workplace cultures to have 
    a better learning experience and to make sure to utilize the time and money efficiently.
