      Dear Hiring Manager, 
      <br />
      <br />
    As a goal-oriented and ambitious final-year Software Engineering student with a passion for coding and 
    web development, I am excited to apply for the Industrus Engineering Graduate Program. With a proven 
    track record of success in my studies and internships, I am confident in my ability to thrive in your 
    dynamic and innovative environment. From developing a full-stack website to teaching coding to kids, I 
    have gained a range of valuable skills and experiences that make me an ideal candidate for this 
    opportunity. I am excited to take on new challenges and contribute my problem-solving and zest for 
    learning to your team. Regarding the selection criteria, I would like to highlight the following 
    experiences and skills that demonstrate my ability to meet each requirement:
    <br />
    <br />
    A commitment to ethical conduct and the highest standards of professional accountability.
    As a Software Engineering intern at a start-up, I was part of a team that was approached by a potential 
    client to develop a CRM system. During the initial consultation, the client mentioned that they were 
    interested in using the CRM to track and monitor their sales team's performance. It was important for 
    me to ensure that our work followed ethical guidelines and industry best practices, especially given the 
    sensitive nature of the information that the client wanted to track. To meet this responsibility, I raised 
    concerns about the ethical implications of the requested features with my team and the client. After 
    careful consideration and a few meetings, they have changed their requirements. Through my 
    commitment to ethical conduct, I was able to maintain the integrity of our company and avoid any 
    potential legal issues and was appreciated by the manager.
    Demonstrated ability to effectively communicate both with other engineers and with stakeholders 
    from different fields.
    <br />
    <br />
    As a Software Engineering intern at Company UTS Rapido, I worked on projects that required 
    collaboration with engineers from the mechatronics department. It was important for me to be able to 
    clearly articulate my ideas and understand the perspectives of my colleagues. To facilitate 
    communication, I actively listened to others and asked clarifying questions when necessary. I also used 
    visual aids, such as diagrams and charts, to help convey my thoughts more effectively. In my role as a 
    Coding Instructor at Junior Engineers, I also had to effectively communicate technical concepts to kids 
    aged 7-15 years. Through my effective communication skills, I have been able to build positive working 
    relationships and effectively teach technical concepts to a diverse audience.
    The ability to engage with a creative, innovative and proactive environment.
    At Mark Logic, I worked as a Web Developer Intern on the development of a dashboard website. It was 
    my responsibility to contribute creative ideas and actively seek out new technologies and techniques 
    that could be applied to the project. To meet this responsibility, I actively participated in brainstorms 
    and brought new ideas to the table by using various platforms like miro and jira. I also researched and 
    experimented with different software technologies and tools to find the best solutions for the project. 
    Through my proactive and innovative approach, I was able to contribute to the development of a 
    successful dashboard website that is currently used by company officials.
    Demonstrated ability to use and manage information. 
    <br />
    <br />
    In my previous internships and coursework, I worked on projects that required me to analyze and 
    interpret large amounts of data. It was my responsibility to extract useful insights from the data and 
    present my findings in a clear and organized manner. To meet this responsibility, I used tools such as 
    Excel and SQL to manipulate and analyse the data. I also created clear and visually appealing 
    presentations to communicate my findings. Through my effective use and management of information, I 
    have been able to provide valuable insights and inform decision-making for my teams.
    The ability to manage your performance in a professional environment.
    <br />
    <br />
     As a Junior Software Developer at Company UTS Rapido, I was often given tasks and projects with 
    tight deadlines. It was important for me to be able to manage my own time and prioritize my workload 
    to meet these deadlines. To meet this responsibility, I used Git analytics tools and Jira to track my 
    performance. I also sought feedback from my supervisors and used it to continuously improve my 
    performance. Through my ability to manage my performance, I have consistently delivered high-quality 
    work on time and contributed to the success of my teams. 
    <br />
    <br />
    A demonstrated ability to work as part of a team and to show leadership when required.
    As a Junior Software Developer at Optik, I led a team of 20 bio-med interns in the development of a 
    full-stack iTX viewer website for a client. It was important for me to effectively collaborate with my team 
    and provide leadership when necessary. To meet this responsibility, I held regular team meetings, 
    communicated clearly, and provided support and resources to my team. I also worked to resolve 
    conflicts and find mutually beneficial solutions. Through my ability to work as part of a team and show 
    leadership when required, I was able to successfully deliver the full-stack iTX viewer website to the 
    client.
